//What is version control and why is it important?

// version control is basically keeping track of changes made to source code
// of a program we can think of it as a checkpoint, if in the future our program stops working
// we can always go back to an old version of our code where everything was fine, it is very important to use
// version control and even more when we work as a team, to make this practice easier there are software
// version control systems that record all modifications made to a program and make it available
// for all the people who work with that code, one of them is git that keeps an exact history of each modification
// within a repository that is where each new modification is stored

// version control helps developers and teams to be efficient, agile and coordinate efforts well
// from each developer to the same code when using version control software, conflicts between
// developers to make a change while another developer makes another change, it is useful when we lose our
// files and we need to recover them since backups are created of each program that we upload to a repository
// for example, in git we use the "$ git pull" command to push our new modifications to the repository
// along with a note describing the changes we made.
